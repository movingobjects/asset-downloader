 * `assets.outputFolder` a plain name — no separators, nothing that climbs out — is what lets it do
 * double duty: it is the folder on disk, and, being a sibling of the JSON file, it is also the
 * path written into the JSON. The two cannot disagree. `outputFile` is required (rather than
 * defaulted) because every source shares one `outputDir`, so nothing keeps two sources' JSON apart
 * unless each names its own. `assets` itself is optional — omit it for a source that is JSON only —
 * but once present it must name its own `outputFolder` for the same reason.
